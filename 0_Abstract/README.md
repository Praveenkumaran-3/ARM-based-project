The automatic control of a vehicle's steering wheel is now one of the most important challenges in the Intelligent Transportation Systems field. A steering control system for the path tracking of autonomous vehicles is described. The steering control system consists of a path tracker and primitive driver. The path tracker generates the desired steering angle by using the look-ahead distance, vehicle heading, and a lateral offset. The steering controller controls the steering actuator to follow the desired steering angle. A DC motor with Incremental encoder is installed to control the steering handle and these messages are transported using CAN protocol.
